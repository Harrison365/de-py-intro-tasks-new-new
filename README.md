# Python Fundamentals

Instructions for today's sprint can be found at: https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/de-python/python-fundamentals

OR HERE lol vvv

Sprint Overview
To get to grips with Python, you will be completing the following tasks:

- Syntax and Control Flow offers you the opportunity to get to grips with some of the basic syntax in Python. It will encourage you to predict behaviour, investigate control flow, and familiarise yourself with pythonic operators.
- Katas will introduce function syntax. It will allow you to develop your problem solving techniques whilst researching tools available in Python. The tests are already written underneath the declaration. We will look at a more formal approach to TDD in a later session.
- Extension Tasks offer some more complicated problems for you to practise your newly formed Python knowledge.

**Virtual Environment Reminder**

Before working through these tasks, remember you'll need to create a virtual environment. To do this, run the command

code block

```python
python -m venv venv
```

which should create a venv directory at the root of your project.

Run the activate binaries using

```python
source venv/bin/activate
```

For this sprint you are not required to write your own tests, but the katas in section 2 have tests written for you. If this is the case, you'll need to install pytest to run these. (Make sure you do this after you have activated your environment.)

```python
pip install pytest

```

To run the tests for each function, run the following command:

```python
pytest <file name>
```

Don't forget to deactivate your virtual environment afterwards with:

```python
deactivate

```
